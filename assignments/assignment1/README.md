# Programming Problem 1: Input, Processing, Output

> The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding and application of the concepts discussed in **Week 1**: 
>
> - obtain user input
> - perform calculations and 
> - produce valid output

## Specifications

Write a program (use the file `assignment1.py` in the text editor on the right) to prompt the user to input hours worked and rate per hour. Compute and display the amount to pay. 


*Remember*: You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data at this point.

## Execute and Test your program 

*Remember*: in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:
```
python assignment1.py
```

Use the following test data to make sure your program produces correct resutls.

Enter hours worked: 35

Enter rate per hour: 2.75

96.25

If you want you can test your program with different inputs!

## Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself before that...
Login with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

If you do not have generated a Personal Access ToKen follow the instructions: 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/assignments/assignment1
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 problem1.py
```

{% next %}

## Submit your code

Execute the command below, logging in with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

```
submit50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/assignments/assignment1
```

You can re-submit your solution as many times as you want.
When you are happy with your solution, download the code and upload it to Canvas.
