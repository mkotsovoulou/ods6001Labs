# Programming Problem 6: Data Structures - Part A

> The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding and application of the concepts discussed up to **Week 5**:
>
> - read data from files
> - parse and extract information
> - load data into sets
> - perform set operations 

## Specifications

Create a program which will read information from two text files containing names of students in two courses: course 1 and course 2.
The file contains one lastname and a firstname per line separated by commas ,
Load the data in two sets of tuples called course1 and course2

When the data are loaded to the following:
1. Count how many unique students exist 
2. Count how many students take both courses
3. Count how many students appear in course 1 but not in course 2.

Display the output in a single line, one number after the other 
for example: 10 5 2

I am using sample numbers and not the actual output

## Execute and Test your program 

*Remember*: in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:

```
python assignment6.py

```


## Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself before that...
Login with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

If you do not have generated a Personal Access ToKen follow the instructions: 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/assignments/assignment6
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 assignment6.py
```

{% next %}

## Submit your code

Execute the command below, logging in with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

```
submit50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/assignments/assignment6
```

You can re-submit your solution as many times as you want.
When you are happy with your solution, download your code and upload it to Canvas.
