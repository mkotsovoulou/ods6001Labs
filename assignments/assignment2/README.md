# Programming Problem 2: Conditional Execution and Exception Handling

> The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding and application of the concepts discussed in **Week 2**:
>
> - conditional execution
> - user input validation and exception handling

## Specifications

Enhance assignment 1 to calculate the pay 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40. 

The code to prompt the user for input is already created for you...

Add exception handling so if the user types characters instead of a number the program displays `Wrong input`

Compute and display **only** the amount to pay depending on the hours worked.

{% next %}

## Execute your program 

*Remember*: in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:

```
python assignment2.py
```

Use the following test data to make sure your program produces correct resutls.

### TEST 1:

Enter hours worked: 35

Enter rate per hour: 2.75

96.25


### TEST 2:

Enter hours worked: 45

Enter rate per hour: 10.50

498.75



### TEST 3:

Enter hours worked: a

Wrong input

----------------------------------------------------------------
If you want you can test your program with different inputs!

## Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself before that...
Login with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

If you do not have generated a Personal Access ToKen follow the instructions: 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/assignments/assignment2
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 assignment2.py
```

{% next %}

## Submit your code

Execute the command below, logging in with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

```
submit50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/assignments/assignment2
```

You can re-submit your solution as many times as you want.
When you are happy with your solution, download the code and upload it to Canvas.
