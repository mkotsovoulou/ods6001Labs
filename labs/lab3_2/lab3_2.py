# the PSEUDOCODE of the solution of this program is as follows:

# Open the datafile.txt


# Read the file contents into a string variable


# Split the file into 'lines' for processing


# Initialize a sum variable to 0

# Loop through each line in the collection of 'lines' retrieved from the file
    # if the line contains xmax
        # extract the number 
        # add the number to the sum

# print the sum
