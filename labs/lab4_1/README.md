# Python Lab 4.1: Use Lists

> The purpose of this practice is to help you apply the concepts discussed up to **now**: 
>
> - read file contents
> - manipulate strings
> - add data to a list
> - search in a list

In `lab4_1.py` in the text editor at top-right, write a program which will:

- Open the datafile.txt and read it line by line. 

- For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method. 

- The program should build a list of words. 

- For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. 

- When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.



Your output should look like the following:
```
['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already', 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief', 'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft', 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window', 'with', 'yonder']
```



## Execute your program 

Remember in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:
```
python lab4_1.py
```

Check that your code produces correct results. 

For the sample datafile the outout shoud be:
['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already', 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief', 'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft', 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window', 'with', 'yonder']


### Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself also.


```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/labs/lab4_1
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 lab4_1.py
```


## Submit your code

Execute the command below, logging in with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

If you do not have generated a Personal Access ToKen follow the instructions: 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```
submit50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/labs/lab4_1
```

You can re-submit your solution as many times as you want.
When you are happy with your solution, download the code and upload it to Canvas.
