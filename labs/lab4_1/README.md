# Python Lab 4.1: Use Lists

> The purpose of this practice is to help you apply the concepts discussed up to **now**:
>
> - read file contents
> - manipulate strings
> - add data to a list
> - search in a list

To start this lab practice type in the terminal:
```
code lab4_1.py
```

In `lab4_1.py` in the text editor at top-right, write a program which will:

- Open the datafile.txt and read it line by line.

- For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method.

- The program should build a list of words.

- For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list.

- When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.



Your output should look like the following:
```
['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already', 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief', 'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft', 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window', 'with', 'yonder']
```



## Execute your program

Remember in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:
```
python lab4_1.py
```

Check that your code produces correct results.

For the sample datafile the outout shoud be:
['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already', 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief', 'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft', 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window', 'with', 'yonder']


### Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself also.


```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/labs/lab4_1
```

## Submit your code

When you are happy with your solution, download the code and upload it to Blackboard.
