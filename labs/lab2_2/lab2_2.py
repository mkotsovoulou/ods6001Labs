# Define the add function
# The function should accept one parameter called "x", and return the "total"
def add():
    total = 0
    # repeat the steps below "x" times:
        # ask the user for a number 
        # validate that the user types a number - if not display 'Wrong input' and quit
        # add the number to the total

    return total


# This is the main program function
def main():
    sum = 0
    # Ask the user how many numbers they want to add and assign it to a variable called "numbers"
    # (Validate user input and quit if not a number)


    # Call the add function by passign numbers as an argument. Assign the value returned from the function to the sum variable
    

    # print the sum
