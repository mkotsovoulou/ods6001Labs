# Python Lab 6.1: OOP
> The purpose of this practice is to help you apply the concepts discussed up to **now**:
>
> - implement object classes and develop program to use them
> - test, debug and predict program behaviour

To start this lab practice type in the terminal:
```
code lab6_1.py
```

In `lab6_1.py` in the text editor at top-right, The exercise template contains a pre-defined ShoppingList class, which can be used to model a shopping list. Your task is to add a method to the class definition. You do not need to change any methods already defined.

## Specifications

Assuming we have a ShoppingList object referenced in a variable named my_list, the object can be handled with method add_item to add in the shopping list items and their quanitites.
You can use the following code to test the Shopping List object functionality:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = ShoppingList()
    my_list.add_item("bananas", 10)
    my_list.add_item("apples", 5)
    my_list.add_item("pineapple", 1)

```
### To Do - 1

In the main program (not in the class) complete the code of a function named `total_units(my_list: ShoppingList)`, which takes a ShoppingList type object as its argument.

The function should calculate the total number of units in the Shopping List, and return this value.

The final print statement can be used to test the functionality of your method.

```
print(total_units(my_list))

```
<details>
<summary>
HINT 1: how to solve the function to calculate the total units
</summary>

```
def total_units(my_list):
    quantity = 0
    for i in range(1, my_list.number_of_items()+1):
        quantity = quantity + my_list.qty(i)
    return quantity

```
</details>

### To Do - 2

Move the code which prints all the items and their quantities of the shopping list in the print_shopping_list method. Remove the pass statement!
Call the method

```
def print_shopping_list(my_list):
    pass
```


## Execute and Test your program

Remember in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:
```
python lab6_1.py
```

Check that your code produces correct results (30 total units).

```
bananas: 22 units
apples: 7 units
pineapple: 1 units
30
```



### To Do - 3

Before submitting, comment out the printing of the shopping list items and just output the total number of items


### Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself also.


```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/labs/lab6_1
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 lab6_1.py
```



## Submit your code

When you are happy with your solution, download the code and upload it to Blackboard.
